## Advanced Python for General Computing & NLP

1.Function using list, filter, lambda that can tell whether a number is a Fibonacci number or not. A pre-calculated list/dict to store fab numbers till 10000 is used
Using list comprehension (and zip/lambda/etc if required) five different expressions are written

2.Iterables a and b such that a is even and b is odd is written
  a.  Strips every vowel from a string provided (tsai>>t s)
  B.  Acts like a ReLU function for a 1D array
  c.  Acts like a sigmoid function for a 1D array
  D.  Takes a small character string and shifts all characters by 5 (handle boundary conditions) tsai>>yxfn

A list comprehension expression 
  a. Takes a ~200 word paragraph (write your own paragraph to check), and checks whether it has any of the swear words mentioned in https://github.com/RobertJGabriel/Google-profanity-words/blob/master/list.txt PTS:200
Using reduce functions:
  a. Add only even numbers in a list
  b. Find the biggest character in a string (printable ascii characters)
  c. Adds every 3rd number in a list
  d. Using randint, random.choice and list comprehensions, write an expression that generates 15 random KADDAADDDD number plates, where KA is fixed, D stands for a digit, 
  and A stands for Capital alphabets. 10<<DD<<99 & 1000<<DDDD<<9999 
  e. Function where KA can be changed to DL, and 1000/9999 ranges can be provided.
